## About The Project

This codebase is part of the **CM3070 Final Project** submission for the __University of London BSc Computer Science__ degree.

The project is about Classifying Satellite Imagery using Deep Learning. The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate the ability and run a high-accuracy yet tiny model on a Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller. To that end, various model architectures are explored. State-of-the-Art models are built only for demonstration purposes. Transfer Learning is explored to demonstrate the possibility of fine-tuning models for different types of satellites. Finally, a small high accuracy model is built which is deployed on the Pico successfully. A script which runs on the host sends images to the Pico and collects results in a CSV. The results and the final model are evaluated too. TensorFlow Lite is used to convert and deploy the model on the Pico.

## Packages required for this project

Python Packages required for this project:
```
matplotlib
numpy
pandas
pyserial
seaborn
sklearn
tensorflow
```

Other Requirements:

1. `imagemagick` and its `mogrify` command
2. `xxd` command (usually pre-installed on Linux and macOS)


## Setup Instructions

1. Setup a Conda Environment (this project used Miniforge)

2. Install Packages
  * ImageMagick is required to convert TIF files of the UC Merced dataset into JPG
    ```bash
    brew install imagemagick      # MacOS or Linux
    sudo apt install imagemagick  # Ubuntu
    ```

  * For M1 Macs (Source:https://developer.apple.com/metal/tensorflow-plugin/):
      ```bash
      $ conda install -c apple tensorflow-deps
      $ conda activate base
      (base) $ pip install tensorflow-macos tensorflow-metal
      ```

  * For Other OSes, things should just work after setting up Miniforge

  * Install Python Packages:
    ```bash
    $ conda activate base
    (base) $ pip install pyserial numpy tensorflow matplotlib sklearn pandas seaborn
    ```

3. Clone this repo and its `pico-tflmicro` submodule
  ```
  git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/arjunbajaj/final-project.git
  ```

4. Setup the Pico build environment if you want to build the Pico image from source. Otherwise, the pre-built image can be copied from `artifacts/diode.uf2` to the Pico. **See instructions below.**

5. Run `scripts/init_datasets.sh` to download, split and process the datasets.

6. All the notebooks and Pico inferencing can be re-run at this point.

## Deploying an image to the Pico

1. Hold the `BOOTSEL` button on the Pico, and connect the Pico to the computer.
2. Navigate to the Pico drive that shows up (usually named `RPI-RP2`).
3. Copy the `artifacts/diode.uf2` file to the Pico drive.
4. The Pico will unmount automatically and flash the image. Once that happens, disconnect the Pico from the computer.
5. Activate the already-setup `conda` environment: `conda activate base`
5. Run: `python3 scripts/infer-on-pico.py`
6. Connect the Pico to the computer.


## Building an image for the Pico from source

You only need to follow these steps if you want to build the UF2 image yourself. Otherwise, just copy the pre-built UF2 image to the Pico using the instructions above.

1. Setup the Pico SDK following the instructions here for your platform:
https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/pico/getting-started-with-pico.pdf

3. Run the following:

```
$ cd pico
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
```

4. The image is built and ready to be copied. Follow instructions above to copy the `pico/build/diode.uf2` image and run inference.
